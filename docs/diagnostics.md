# Diagnostic Accuracy

Evaluating the accuracy of different testing methods is a core part of the NBS Study. Three diagnostic layers are considered:

1. **Point-of-Care Testing (POCT)**  
2. **Dried Blood Spots (DBS)**  
3. **Genotype-confirmed SCD diagnosis** (reference standard)

Comparative analysis enables the assessment of sensitivity, specificity, and misclassification rates.

## POCT vs Genotype

The study compares POCT results (typically using sickling or solubility tests) against final genotyping results for validation.

### Metrics Computed:

- **Sensitivity**: How well POCT detects true SCD cases (e.g., SS, SC)
- **Specificity**: How well POCT excludes non-SCD cases (e.g., AA)
- **PPV / NPV**: Positive and negative predictive values

### Observations:

- POCT performs **well for SS**, but has lower sensitivity for **compound heterozygotes** (e.g., SC, SÎ²-thal).
- Some misclassification occurs due to:
  - Fetal hemoglobin interference
  - Inexperienced personnel
  - Limitations of visual interpretation

## DBS Comparison

DBS samples are analyzed centrally using IEF or HPLC.

### Key comparisons include:

- **DBS vs IEF/HPLC**: Assesses the **lab-based diagnostic accuracy** of Dried Blood Spot testing against the reference standard.
- **POCT vs IEF/HPLC**: Evaluates the **field-based (POCT) diagnostic performance** against the reference laboratory standard.
- **DBS vs POCT**: Measures **concordance between field and lab results**, highlighting consistency or mismatch between POCT and lab-confirmed DBS results.


### Common Findings:

- DBS tends to have **higher concordance** with genotype than POCT
- Some **discordant cases** highlight delays in lab processing or sample degradation

Statistical comparison was performed using **McNemar's test**
