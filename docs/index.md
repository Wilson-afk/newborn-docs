# Newborn Screening Study

---

## Overview

The **Newborn Screening (NBS)** study is a collaborative initiative developed under the **SickleInAfrica Consortium** and supported by the **SADaCC (South African Data Coordinating Centre)**. It is aimed at improving early detection of **Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)** in newborns across Africa, providing harmonized diagnostic pipelines and structured data collection for public health impact and clinical research.

The **NBS Study** leverages a standardized dataset to screen newborns for sickle cell disease using point-of-care testing (POCT), dried blood spots (DBS), and confirmatory genotyping methods. It represents a unique multi-country infrastructure for high-quality data collection across clinical sites in Africa.

## Objectives of the NBS Study

- Standardize **SCD screening and diagnostic protocols** for newborns across partner sites.
- Enable **early identification of SS, SC, and SÎ²-thalassemia genotypes** through lab-confirmed results.
- Harmonize data on **demographics, clinical features, and genetic diagnosis** into a structured research-ready format.
- Improve **long-term patient tracking** and integration into care pathways.

## What the NBS Study Provides

- Harmonized clinical and genotype datasets across multiple African countries.
- Tools for **data validation, cleaning, and harmonization**.
- Diagnostic accuracy assessments comparing **POCT, DBS**, and **genotype-confirmed SCD** using IEF/HPLC.
- Scripts and pipelines for:
  - Variable harmonization  
  - Data quality checks  
  - Imputation of missing values  
  - Diagnostic comparison metrics
