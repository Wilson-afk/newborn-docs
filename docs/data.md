## Sample & Metadata Sources

The NBS study collects data from:

- **Point-of-care test (POCT)** records
- **Dried blood spot (DBS)** samples
- **Laboratory genotyping results**
- Standardized **demographic and clinical intake forms**

Each sample is uniquely identified and matched to a newborn using a site-specific metadata schema.

## Data Entry & Validation Tools

Data entry is performed using:

- **Electronic data capture tools** such as REDCap and ODK

### Quality Control Processes

- Automatic checks for missing values, date formatting, and value ranges
- ID linking between phenotype (clinical) and genotype datasets
- Site-level dashboards for tracking completeness and anomalies
