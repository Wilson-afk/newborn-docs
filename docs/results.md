# Final Results

## Diagnostic Performance Summary

The table below summarizes the performance of two diagnostic tools â€“ **Dried Blood Spot (DBS)** testing and **Point-of-Care Testing (POCT)** â€“ in comparison to the reference standard (**IEF/HPLC**) across different genotypes. Performance is evaluated using four key metrics:

- **Sensitivity** â€“ Ability to correctly identify true positives  
- **Specificity** â€“ Ability to correctly identify true negatives  
- **PPV (Positive Predictive Value)** â€“ Likelihood that a positive result truly indicates disease  
- **NPV (Negative Predictive Value)** â€“ Likelihood that a negative result truly excludes disease

Current Enrollment: **705 newborns**

## Interpretation

- **DBS testing** showed consistently high sensitivity and specificity for AA, AS, and SS genotypes. Sensitivity for AC was notably lower (39%), indicating detection challenges for this genotype.
- **POCT** performed strongly for AA and AS, but its sensitivity for SS and AC was much lower (50%), suggesting limitations in detecting these critical genotypes using POCT alone.
- Both tests showed excellent **specificity**, with POCT and DBS both scoring 1.00 for SS and AC genotypes.
- **PPV and NPV** were also strong across methods, with values approaching 1.00, indicating robust predictive reliability for most genotypes.
